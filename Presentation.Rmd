## Soil organic matter gets interesting (1804)
<div class="columns-2">

  </div>

Some systematic observations about SOM:  

1. since no continuous accumulation of SOM occurs even with continuous organic inputs, some of these inputs must be destroyed,
2. the amount which is destroyed must, to a certain extent, be proportional to the absolute existing amount,
3. limits to SOM accretion must vary depending on climate, nature of mother bedrock, vegetation, cropping system and fertility of the land,
4. even if all conditions are favorable to SOM accumulation, there must be a maximum for the thickness of the humus layer beyond which destructive causes equal productive ones.

## Soil organic matter gets attention (1938)

A more structured approach to understand its nature initiated during past century:

Jerry Olson (one of the first system ecologists) stated in the incipit of his SOC modeling paper:  
 
> "The net rate of change in energy or material stored in an ecological system
> or its parts equals the rate of income minus the rate of loss."

And described it mathematically with a linear differential equation.
$$
\frac{dC}{dt} = I - k \cdot C
$$

Such equation is still the basis for most SOC models available around.

## The problem of model initialization

## The dream of "data-based" initialization: Yasso, Zimmerman, etc...


## Things get complicated
Soil C models are required to represent more things than just the aerobic C decomposition process.  
In the most recent decades we can observe a very large amount of models being published that are based on many different processes and integrate many components (es. ECOSSE, ORCHIDEE, DayCent).

## One possible tree of SOC models concepts
```{tikz, fig.cap = "", fig.ext = 'png',fig.width=5.5}

\usetikzlibrary{mindmap,shadows}

\begin{tikzpicture}
  \path[mindmap,concept color=black,text=white]
    node[concept] {SOC decay models}
    [clockwise from=0]
    child[concept color=green!50!black] {
      node[concept] {Linear}
      [clockwise from=95]
      child { node[concept] {Minimalist}}
      child { node[concept] {Lab-based initialization}}
      child { node[concept] {Inert} }
      child { node[concept] {Feedback} }
      child[concept color=orange] { node[concept] {continuous} }
    }
    child[concept color=red] { node[concept] {Nonlinear} }

;
\end{tikzpicture}
```

## The basic SOM model choices

* Do we assume some "inert" SOM?
* How many different C pools do we represent?
* Do we represent mass feedbacks?
* Is it fine to use ordinary differential equations, or do we need PDE?

Each of these choices will bring implications in the extrapolation we can do with the model, some quite dramatic.

## The advantages of minimalism: easily solved steady states
No system will accumulate or lose C indefinitely. The rates will always tend to zero.  
When the rate of SOC variation is zero, the system is in **equilibrium**, and inputs equal outputs. For example a land use change from a relatively rich environment (a forest) to an environment with less C inputs (agriculture). SOC will decrease over time until it reaches the new equilibrium:
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%"}
X_0=50
k=0.1
tim=seq(1:100)
L=2
X=c(X_0,(L/k)*(1-exp(-k*tim))+X_0*exp(-k*tim))

plot(c(0,tim), X, type="l", ylim=c(0,55), ylab="C stocks", xlab="Time", yaxt="n", xaxt="n")
abline(h=X_0, lty=2, col="red")
text(10,X_0+1.2, "Initial steady state", col="red", cex=0.6)
abline(h=L/k, lty=2, col="darkgreen")
text(10,L/k+1.2, "Final steady state", col="darkgreen", cex=0.6)

```

## The advantages of minimalism: easily solved steady states
The steady states are, by definition, where the rate of variation $\frac{dC}{dt}=0$. For a single pool model (Olson) this becomes easily solved. The steady state means that for a certain amount of C $C_{ss}$ the variation is zero: $0 = I - k \cdot C_{ss}$, which means $k \cdot C_{ss} = I$ and therefore $C_{ss}=\frac{I}{k}$.
  
A slightly more complicated model, like the two pool (Y and O) ICBM, has still relatively simple analyitcal solution:
$$
Y_{ss}=\frac{I}{k_y}\\
O_{ss}=\epsilon\cdot\frac{I}{k_o}
$$
Any linear model, with an arbitrary number of pools, has an analytical solution. But having it so short and easily manageable can sometimes be useful.

## The advantages of more pools: long-term accuracy

## Representing reality: the view of experimentalists
We know that SOC decomposition is process mediated by microbes, their growth and by their exoenzymes production, so representing these processes will produce more accurate models.

## The cyclical discussion: is more realistic more better?
Making decomposition controlled by enzymes/microbes means making the model nonlinear, moving from ordinary differential equations to partial differential equations.

![](SOC.png){width=70%}

Nonlinearities in models can lead to weird behaviors depending on their structure and parameterizaton, for example oscillations.  
Because of the nonlinear (more than linear) effects, any mistake can have an amplificated effect on predictions.

## More complicated (nonlinear) models bring extrapolation uncertainty

## Scary: linear algebra for linear models
Compartmental models can be expressed within a generic linear algebra (matrix) notation
$$
\frac{dC_{(t)}}{dt}=I_{(t)} + A_{(t)} \cdot C_{(t)}
$$
For example the ICBM model (assuming constant average inputs), written explicitly, is:
$$
 \frac{dC_{(t)}}{dt}=\begin{bmatrix} I\\  0\\  \end{bmatrix} +
  \xi \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix} -k_y & \epsilon \\ 0 & -k_o  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
    \begin{bmatrix} Y \\ O \end{bmatrix}
$$
This notation allows us to generalize and makes easy to see the main differences between model structures:
```{r}

df <- data.frame (first_column  = c("$I+\\xi \\cdot A \\cdot C_{(t)}$", "$I+\\xi \\cdot A (C_{(t)}) \\cdot C_{(t)}$"),
                  second_column = c("$I+\\xi_{(t)} \\cdot A \\cdot C_{(t)}$", "$I+\\xi (t) \\cdot A (C_{(t)}) \\cdot C_{(t)}$")
                  )
colnames(df)<-c("Autonomous", "Non-autonomous")
rownames(df)<-c("Linear", "Non-linear")
  
knitr::kable(df)
```

(it has also the pretty neat advantages of making quite easy to find the analytical steady state for anything linear...)
